# Genetic algorithm - Monalisa

This project is about genetic algorithms, in particular is about the representation of Monalisa.

I created a pyhton script that, with the help of tkinter, create random polygons in an image.


## Setup

To install the requirements:

sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run

python monalisa.py [name_image.format]



**Example** : python monalisa.py image.png


Make sure to have the image file and the file.html with script.js in the same folder of monalisa.py


## Runtime

It will create an image, called pic.png, that is a new image based on the one passed by argument. 

Also it will be open in the browser, that automatically refresh the image.

The program will take a lot of time to make and image similar to the orgiginal.
